        <h2>Before your fine art portrait session:</h2>
                <p>All clients receive a free in person consultation.  Your consultation will occur at a coffee shop on the NE side of Cedar Rapids.  At your consultation, we will collaborate together about your fine art session and talk about wardrobe selections, hair, and make up. We will also go over pricing, contracts and other legalities. Don't worry....it's not at all stressful!  To make your session official and put it on my calendar, a signed contract and a $200 deposit (plus applicable sales tax) is required. </p>
